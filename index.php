        <h1>Experiences gathered, over the <span>years</span>.</h1>
        <p>
            I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe ranging from ecommerce websites to complex solutions with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences.
            <br /><br />
            Currently, I work at LucigHub as a Full stack developer and UI designer. I design all the User Interface Apps that I build using different languages to achieve the magic I do on the browser.
            <br /><br />
            Before now, I was Senior Full stack at AgroNigeria publiching company. I gather all the database of participants and delegates for varius submits they organize across Africa while I design design different newsletters that will be sent out weekly.
            <br /><br />
            Prior to AgroNigeria, I was a frontend engineering contractor with Bengraph, a South Africa company known for their innovative, fintech software development.
            <br /><br />
            I once also led the frontend team at a AgroAfrica startup sister company to AgroNigeria publiching company, as they held their first submit in August, 2017 in Japan.
